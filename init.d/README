In this directory you may put files that will be executed by puppet at time of 
build. The file names should match:

Filename                Hosts
--------                ------
init                    All hosts.
init.$hostname          That specific host.
init.$operatingsystem   All hosts with that operating system.
init.$lsbdistcodename   All hosts with that distribution release.
